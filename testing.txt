Program Correctness
-------------------
I used JUnit to verify the correctness of my project. I have ~25 unit tests
that demonstrate the proper working of my implementations of graph functions:
inserting arcs/vertices, annotating graph elements, reversing arcs, removing 
arcs/vertices, etc.

I verified the results of my graph by checking them against the graphs in the
project description page. All metrics from my graphs matched those of the 
sample graphs.

Graph Results
-------------
Graph results can be seen in output.txt.
