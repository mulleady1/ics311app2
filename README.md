Compilation
-----------
The easiest way to compile my project is to use the 'run' script I wrote, which is 
located in this directory. Use it like this:
    
    ./run <vna_file> [<vna_file> ...]

You can provide as many vna file arguments as you wish. All vna files from Dr. Suthers'
project description page are already in this directory, with the exception of the last
file, web-google.vna.
